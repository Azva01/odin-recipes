Recipe project for practicing HTML and CSS

This project was created to work as practice for recently viewed lessons about HTML coding. I'm expected to be able to write the basic HTML boilerplate and set it up properly, create a simple landing page with headers, including italic and strong text. There needs to be examples of lists, including images and absolute links.
