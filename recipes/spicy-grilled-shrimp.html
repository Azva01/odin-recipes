    <h2>How to Grill Shrimp</h2>
   
    <p>
        In terms of flavor, the miso glaze is the star here, but the charred scallion vinaigrette is a very close second. Charred scallions are a great way to take advantage of a hot broiler. They cook alongside the marinated salmon, simply oiled and salted, developing a blistered outer layer that adds a delicate crispiness and losing the sharp onion-y bite in favor of more mild, slightly sweet notes. Chopped and tossed with rice wine vinegar and oil, they make for an easy, savory dressing that you’ll keep coming back to again and again.
