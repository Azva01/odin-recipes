    <p>
        Miso is a Japanese cooking staple made from fermented soybeans, and it’s the ultimate pantry powerhouse. It’s got toasty, deeply savory, and slightly sweet notes that pair well with hearty fish like salmon or cod, but it can also amplify the flavor of roasted veggies or even baked goods. Salmon always calls for a sidekick, and in this case, we turned to our current obsession: farro. The dense, chewy grains have a more interesting texture than rice or quinoa, adding an instant layer of fun to your meal.

        In terms of flavor, the miso glaze is the star here, but the charred scallion vinaigrette is a very close second. Charred scallions are a great way to take advantage of a hot broiler. They cook alongside the marinated salmon, simply oiled and salted, developing a blistered outer layer that adds a delicate crispiness and losing the sharp onion-y bite in favor of more mild, slightly sweet notes. Chopped and tossed with rice wine vinegar and oil, they make for an easy, savory dressing that you’ll keep coming back to again and again.

    <h3>
        Instructions:
    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk ginger, miso, soy sauce, sesame oil, 2 grated garlic cloves, 2 tablespoons vinegar, 3 tablespoons brown sugar, and a pinch of red pepper until smooth. Pat salmon dry; season both sides with salt. Spoon miso mixture over salmon and spread to coat. Refrigerate, uncovered, at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, toss cabbage with 1/2 teaspoon salt and remaining 1 teaspoon brown sugar; set aside until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Fill a medium pot halfway with water; stir in 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil over high heat and add farro. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until farro is tender but slightly chewy, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain and return to pot. Cover and set aside until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Place a rack in upper third of oven; turn on broiler. Line a large sheet tray with foil, then place a wire rack on tray. Arrange scallions on rack and drizzle with 1 tablespoon neutral oil; season with salt. Wipe off a majority of marinade from salmon and arrange on rack next to scallions.</li>
        <li>Broil salmon and scallions, watching closely, until salmon is cooked through and flesh easily flakes with a fork and scallions are charred, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Transfer scallions to a cutting board. Finely chop scallions and transfer to a medium bowl. Add cilantro and remaining 1 grated garlic clove, 4 tablespoons neutral oil, 2 tablespoons vinegar, and pinch of red pepper and whisk to combine; season with salt. Add 2 tablespoons scallion dressing to pot with farro and toss until combined.</li>
        <li>Add cucumber and carrots to bowl with cabbage and toss with remaining scallion dressing. Divide farro among bowls or plates. Top with salmon and cabbage salad.</li>
